        <p>
          Hello, my name is Jesse. I started this new journey to code following
          a conversation I had with my parents after I left a 10+ year career in
          customer service. I wanted to get into web development AND game
          development so I applied for Dev Academy in Wellington and I am
          hooked! What an eye opening experience, a Barista turned, Call Centre
          Representative turned aspiring developer. I am looking for full time
          employment.
