        <p>
          Hello, my name is Jesse. I have started this new journey to code
          following a conversation I had with my parents after I left the
          Hospitality / Healthcare sectors to pursue a new career path. I
          decided I wanted to get into web development AND game development so I
          applied for Dev Academy in Wellington and I am hooked! What an eye
          opening experience, a Barista turned, Call Centre Representative
          turned aspiring developer. I enjoy the creative freedom and problem
          solving techniques used in web development.
