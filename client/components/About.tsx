      <p className="position-left">
        Hello, my name is Jesse and I am a keen learner with an interest in game
        development and penetration testing. I have started this new journey to
        code as I am fascinated with how creative you can be. The vast amount of
        people I have already met throughout my time at Dev Academy has been
        exceptionally eye opening. I encourage those who are thinking about
        moving into this industry to take the leap as I have done!
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Github link will show you the code I have been using also the projects
          I am currently working on and am excited to see where this goes!
